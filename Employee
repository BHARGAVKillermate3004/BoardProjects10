/*2.	Write a program with an “Employee” class having two variables one for the name of employee (String) and other for base salary (float).
Create a function that calculates the total salary by adding 50% HRA to the salary and returns.
Create an object of this class in main function and set the name of the employee, call the salary function and print the calculated salary
returned by the function with name of the employee.*/
